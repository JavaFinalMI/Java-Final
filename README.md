This video game is titled "Zombie Wasteland Survival". In each textbox, choices will be in the forms of buttons. Click on these buttons to make your choice. At the beginning, there are three difficulties to choose from. Each difficulty makes the random number generator much harder to succeed at, so choose wisely. The choices you make will reflect upon how you continue, and what you can achieve. To win, you have to survive for 4 days in whichever area you choose. There are many ways to die, so be careful out there.
